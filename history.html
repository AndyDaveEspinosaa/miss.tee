                <h1>History Of Cauayan!</h1>
                <h3>
                    Before the Spaniards came to Negros, this town was a wilderness and local indigenous people dwelling there depended on hunting and fishing. The site from where the town began was covered with bamboo thickets called kawáyan in the Hiligaynon language, hence the name "Cauayan" (pronounced kawayán, "place where bamboo grows abundantly).

In 1822, Cauayan was formally founded by Don Vicente Paulo Decena, believed to have come from Cebu. During the Spanish era, a seat for the municipal government was sought. Guiljungan, Cauayan and Isio were candidates but Isio prevailed as it was more populated. It received the honor of being the center of government although gobernadorcillos were accorded to Cauayan and Guiljungan.

Progress was stalled during that period since the Spanish rulers were reluctant to educate their subjects. Even when they built schools, only a few privileged were admitted to them. There were no roads and most people were required to render forced labor. When the Americans came in 1904, the tribunal in Isio was shifted to Cauayan and this fostered socioeconomic development. The inhabitants of Cauayan were taught modern agricultural techniques to raise crops, and public infrastructure such as schoolhouses, roads and bridges were built.
